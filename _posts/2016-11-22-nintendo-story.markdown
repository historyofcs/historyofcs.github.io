# Nintendo Story

This article is about how Nintendo transformed itself from it's origins to a video games giant. It didn't start as a tech company as many other companies. Well they had their history in games, but it was not in video games. Because in  1889 when the company was founded, the video games didn't exist yet due to absence of television. Originally the company was named "Nintendo Koppai" and it was a small business based in Koyoto and it produced Hanafuda Cards. Hanafuda Cards are very similar to standard 52  playing card that we play Poker with. Nintendo's cards back then where made my hand and quickly gained a lot of popularity.

 In 1953 the company was run by the grandson of the Nintendo's founder Hiroshi Yamauchi and was the first to produce plastic playing cards in Japan. The idea of plastic cards proved to be extremely popular and resulted in Nintendo dominating the industry. However, in 1956 he visited the United States and met with the largest card manufacturers and was very surprised by how small their offices were, so he came to the conclusion that card's business is very limited and will not make it.
     Innovation came in 1956 when Disney was found. Nintendo made a deal where they were able to print Disney characters on their cards. This opened them and entire new market. Up until that point, playing cards were used  exclusively only for gambling. With this new target audience Nintendo created books that explained what games could be played with the new cards. It came to be very successful, around  thousand cards were sold in the first year.
Unfortunately playing cards business came to a saturation point after a couple of years. Japanese stopped buying then and the Nintendo's stock fell from 900 to 60 yen. In 1956 the company hired a new maintenance engineer. His name was Gunpei Yokoi and he would soon help turn Nintendo grow incredibly fast.
     Nintendo was struggling to keep itself in the toy industry but their playing cards were not really helping. That was about to change though. In 1970, when Hiroshi made a tour in his company noticed the Gunpei Yokoi playing with an extended arm that he has made. Deciding to take a gamble, Hiroshi requested Gunpei Yokoi to develop his  arm as a proper product and  release it in time for Christmas.

The product was so popular that over a million units were sold and it made a hit and Gunpei was immediately raised in position at product development.    He was very successful thanks to his engineer background and invented many other electronic toys (including  Love Tester)

This was significant because Nintendo was the only company that produced such type of toys so they were able to charge higher prices and made a great profit.
